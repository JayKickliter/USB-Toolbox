## About

Simple Cocoa application to send Vendor Requests and Bulk Transfers (for now). It is still very early in development.

## Documentation

I just started learning Doxygen, so it's pretty [sparse](./Documentation/html/index.html) right now.  

## Prerequisites

Xcode project settings assume you have LibUSB installed and located at `/opt/local/lib/libusb-1.0.0.dylib`.
